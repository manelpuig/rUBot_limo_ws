# **3. Limo Vision**

The Limo is equipped with a Jetson Nano computer. This PC is designed for doing advanced parallel processing such as Deep Learning. Weâ€™re going to use these capabilities to find objects and better understand the environment around the robot

This package has to be **cloned and compiled on the real robot**. This needs a GPU computer to run!
- You will need to clone and build the vision package.
